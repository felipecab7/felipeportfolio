            <p class="p-0 justify-text ">It was the day of the show. Minutes before going on stage I heard my name. My
              excitement turned into terror, my heart kept beating faster and my hands would not stop sweating. A couple
              of months prior, I had been given the opportunity to sing at my first large event, in front of two hundred
              people.</p>

            <p class="p-0 justify-text text-indent pb-10">

              Once I got to the door behind stage, I was given a microphone. But something wasn't right — it was a wireless microphone, unlike the one we had been using in rehearsal. As if I wasn't already nervous that my voice would be heard by so many people, I knew that If I didn't move around the stage I would look awkward, lost, and nervous.
</p>



            <p class="p-0 justify-text  text-indent pb-10"">I finally got on stage, lights went on, and I started singing. I sounded a little nervous at first, but as time passed, I became more comfortable. I focused so much on the song that I forgot the audience was there. It was as if stepping on stage brought out an inner self full of energy and confidence. It felt amazing. Despite my far from perfect performance, it felt right to be in front of an audience and see their emotional response.</p>

            <p class=" p-0 justify-text text-indent pb-10"">I wasn't the best at singing, but fortunately, I knew how to play the piano. This pushed me to continue learning how to read music and convey emotions through songs. I then picked up other interests in filmmaking, painting, and graphic design.</p>

            <p class="p-0 justify-text  text-indent pb-10"">After analyzing multiple career paths, I realized the underlying reason I loved making songs, paintings, and short films was the story structure behind them.</p>

              <p class="p-0 justify-text pb-10">It was
                fascinating to see how a well-crafted story can impact somebody's life: How an animated movie can make
                adults cry, how a song can make an audience sit on the edge of their seats, and how a great story can
                make
                designers engage in a more personal way with users. There is no doubt this is the reason I loved
                performing from the beginning. All those family gatherings were the best channel for me to <span

              <p class="p-0 justify-text  text-indent pb-10"">My increased interest in graphic design and storytelling led me to
              apply to the School of Information at <span class =" regularitalic ">the University of Michigan where I earned a degree in User
                Experience Design.</span> I learned how to better listen to users, understand the story behind their struggles,
              and engage with teammates and stakeholders in discussions grounded in those root needs. I learned that
              —just like in a movie— users see themselves as the heroes of their own journeys, with a set of obstacles,
              wanting to hire products that help them overcome those struggles. <span class =" highlight-book-blue"> As
                a UX designer, I will make sure those struggling moments drive the product development process so that
