                The Sumi prototype was the culmination of a semester-long
                project for SI 482 - Interaction Design Studio at the University
                of Michigan. We learned to define and narrow the scope of a
                problem, analyze the competitive landscape, empathize with
                users, ideate solutions and test them.
                <u
                  >The final deliverable was a working prototype supporting 15 -
                  30 user interactions taking place across 5-10 panels.</u
                >
              </p>

              <h3>Role</h3>

              <p>
                I worked on the project with three other students. We all
                participated in the problem definition phase and competitive
                analysis. Once we started the ideation process, tasks were
                divided. I focused on transferring our design ideas into
                well-crafted paper prototypes and digital prototypes. I was also
                in charge of mapping out the interactions within the prototype
                using Invision.

              <h4>01 - Defining the problem</h4>

              <p>
                One of the requirements of the first stage of this project was
                to find a problem that adhered to the CHI 2019 student competition’s
                main theme: Weaving the Threads within the Social Fabric. We
                were encouraged to consider the ways that technology might be
                used to strengthen our social fabric --how individuals interact
                with each other within a community. We choose to tackle the
                problem many people face when making new year's resolutions:
                following through with those promises. We believed one of the
                reasons this happens is the lack of an accountability system
                where goals would be shared in a group setting and members would
                push each other to succeed.
              </p>

              <h4>02 - Competitive analysis</h4>

              <p>
                We kicked off the research phase by analyzing the competitive
                landscape of our problem. We identified four competitors.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>Coach.me: </b> Direct competitor as it offers web and app
                    interfaces to allow users to track habits and share it with
                    friends or the community for accountability. The main tactic
                    that is used to keep users accountable is to hire a personal
                    certified coach who will guide them through meeting specific
                    goals. Coach.me stresses that having just the habit tracker
                    with progress reports and target reminders is helpful but
                    the real accountability and productivity comes in with
                    guidance from coaches. There is also a hidden feature that
                    allows users to import their data to a CSV so that they can
                    see which habits are really sticking and which aren’t.
                    Something that the app does that we can consider for our
                    product is using positive reinforcement instead of negative
                    as Coach.me stresses building good habits instead of
                    breaking bad ones.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>Find Your Ditto: </b> An application that focuses on
                    bringing people with chronic illnesses together. The
                    positive aspects of this platform are that it allows users
                    to find peers with similar experiences to chat with each
                    other, either through online messaging or selecting/creating
                    meetups in the app, and that users can only enter a
                    community with an access code. The con of this app is that
                    it does not allow any other sort of medium for
                    communication, such as video or photo. We picked this app
                    because it is a parallel competitor, which means it offers
                    similar features to the same audience but does not directly
                    compete against our product.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>Facebook Messenger: </b> We picked Facebook Messenger to
                    be our analogous competitor because we were inspired by the
                    community of content sharing that the application evokes.
                    Some positive features of Messenger are its accessibility
                    over multiple platforms (mobile and desktop) and being able
                    to utilize emojis, GIFs, and voice messages to portray
                    emotions. A con with this platform is that it is not focused
                    on meeting new users. We will attempt to use Messenger’s
                    principles by encouraging positive content sharing that
                    makes people feel good about their own goals as well as
                    those of others. Omnifocus is a productivity app that allows
                    users to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and projects. This
                    is an indirect competitor because it offers a partial
                    solution to our customer segment. One of the positive
                    aspects of this application is that it allows users to enter
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>HabitShare: </b> Direct competitor that allows users to
                    share their habits with friends for extra accountability and
                    motivation. Its best features include being able to
                    customize who sees each habit you are tracking, creating
                    custom goals, and being able to set custom reminders.
                    HabitShare focuses on sharing habits with a user’s existing
                    social network, while we want to give users the option to
                    also find support outside of their social network.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                From this analysis, our team learned about several applications
                that are diverse in user goals but all want to bring users
                together in the end. We also gained a better idea of what we
                want to implement and expand on in our own application. For
                instance, we liked how Coach.me utilizes positive reinforcement
                to encourage its users to build good habits instead of insisting
                them to break their bad ones. On the other hand, we admired
                HabitShare’s feature of sharing habits with a user’s existing
                social network, but we would like to expand on this idea by
                allowing users to create or find support groups with others that
                are outside of their existing social network. The competitive
                analysis process allowed us to scope out the current
                accountability app environment and develop a focus for how our
                product will be constructed.

                <b>Kate’s background:</b> Kate is a journalist with a background
                in copywriting and blogging. She also has experience working in
                public relations with multiple companies in Chicago. Katy loves
                storytelling and writing, so she keeps a journal where she does
                self-reflection and daily planning. Her passion for storytelling
                comes from her desire to bring communities closer. Katy has
                volunteered for multiple organizations since she graduated from
                college and plans to build her own non-profit in the near
                future.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Her story:</b> As Katy is getting ready for work, she
                receives a notification from “the app”. Katy checks her phone
                and sees Sylvia, a member from her group, has sent a
                motivational message to everyone in the group reminding them to
                stay on track today. Katy cares for her health and wants to
                incorporate a variety of good habits into her daily routine, and
                she has decided she wants to start by cutting sugar out of her
                diet. After unsuccessfully trying to turn a sugar free diet into
                a habit with several health tracking apps, Katy has only cheated
                a few times since joining “the app” last month. Katy has never
                met Sylvia or the other members in her group. They were matched
                together because they opted to be in a group with strangers and
                have the same goals. At Katy’s work, it’s a co-worker’s
                birthday. Katy declines a piece of cake that’s being offered to
                her because she knows she’s going to have to check in with the
                group tonight on “the app”. In the evening, Katy receives a
                notification from the app reminding her to report her daily
                progress to her group. She likes being able to reflect on the
                decisions she made throughout the day and thrives off the
                positive feedback she receives from her group when she tells
                them she had another sugar free day
              </p>

              <h4>04 - Design Space Analysis</h4>

              <figure>
                <img src="css/imgs/sumi/sumiQOC.png" alt="image" />
              </figure>

              <p><b>QOC: </b> How should the group page be laid out?</p>
              <p><b>Option Selected: </b> List</p>

              <p>
                We approached the design rationale with the goal of affording
                the user to choose the right group they want to look at in a
                quick manner. These are groups that the user has already chosen
                to be a part of for themselves. The list option follows strong
                convention with the text menu like look allowing the user to
                quickly scroll through no matter the screen size. Since the
                groups are distinguished in text in the list option, it allows
                the user to quickly recognize the group instead of having to
                recall it from memory. The tab option is convention for computer
                browsers but will be hard to translate for a smaller mobile
                screen. Although having the tab option would allow the user to
                choose between different groups and see the messages within the
                groups all in one step, it would be hard to have all the groups
                up at once without the tabs getting squished together up top.
                The square/icon look would be the most visually pleasing and
                just as easy to quickly scroll through as the list option but it
                doesn’t follow strong convention and would be hard to recognize
                off the bat with just an icon differentiating each group.
                Although all three had its pros, after further deliberation, we
                have decided to go with the list option.
              </p>

              <p><b>QOC: </b> How should we display progress?</p>
              <p><b>Option Selected: </b> ​​Circle Progress Bar</p>

              <p>
                The goal of the progress bar is to help users track their
                advancement in their goals. They should be able to clearly
                visualize a pattern that is easy to understand. We selected the
                circle progress bar because we felt it would be a strong
                convention, show clear growth, and simple to visualize key
                milestones. While we found a line graph to easily track progress
                and visualize information, it was not a strong convention for
                what users see as a progress indicator. For a straight line as a
                progress bar, we thought it is good for showing growth and
                milestones, but it does not follow conventions as a measure of
                progress either.

              <p><b>QOC: </b> How should we organize our content feed?</p>
              <p><b>Option Selected: </b> One Single Feed</p>

              <p>
                The goal of our content feed is to provide a place for users to
                see content from their groups. They should be able to do tasks
                such as see likes on a message posted in a group, view a video,
                respond to a poll, and click on links without having to be on
                the group’s page itself. We chose the single feed option because
                we believe users would benefit from viewing content from all of
                their groups at once. Instead of only seeing the name of the
                group and having to click on it to access its information, users
                do not have to make any extra clicks and leave the page in a
                single feed. While a categorized feed is goal-driven, it is not
                easy to scan content from groups because the user has to open
                each individual chat to see what is being discussed.

              <h4>05 - Paper prototype</h4>

              <p>
                After conduncting the QOC analysis and drawing intial mockups of
                the screens, we proceeded to create paper prototypes with two
                tasks in mind: create a group and join a group. This process allowed us
                to test the interactions before transitioning into a digital
                protoype.

                Our high fidelity prototype was the culmination of weeks spent
                ideating, desining and iterating. We transitioned to digital
                after learning through mockups, wireframes and paper prototypes
                what impact our ideas would have on users. Thanks to the nature
                of rapid iteration, many of the wrong assumptions we had were
                discarded and that helped us move forward towards
                functionalities that based on data made a positive impact on
                users.
