                    <h3>Target audience</h3>
                    <p>For my senior design project, my team was tasked with improving the accessibility
                        of Franklin County’s Matterhorn platform for American Sign Language individuals. The main goals
                        of
                        the project were to ensure that ASL individuals have the same "access" to justice, regardless
                        of their level of comfort with online platforms and level of English proficiency.<br></p>


                    <h3>Research phase</h3>

                    <p>In order to understand ALS users mental models when it comes to accessing
                        online mediation, we developed a research phase plan involving five milestones and questions
                        related to these goals.<br></p>


                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> Develop an understanding of <strong>how ASL individuals communicate,
                                    both with ASL and non-ASL individuals.</strong>

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <p> Determine <strong>how current online platforms assist </strong> as well as
                                fall short in allowing ASL individuals to achieve online goals.</p>


                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> Determine what <strong>assistive tools </strong>ASL individuals use, if any, to help
                                them achieve
                                online goals.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p> Gain a thorough understanding of the <strong>court resources that are available to ASL
                                    individuals </strong>
                                and how they aid or hinder these individuals in achieving their goals related to legal
                                processes.</p>

                        </li>

                            <p> Gain a thorough understanding of how English proficiency <strong>affects how

                                    to an
                                    ASL user.</strong> </p>

                    <h3>UX Methods</h3>
                    <h4>Heuristic evaluation</h4>

                    <p>The Matterhorn platform for Franklin County Municipal Court was evaluated by eacg team
                        member. Each evaluator attempted to complete the core tasks of the platform, all while
                        evaluating each task against a set of usability heuristics. Each evaluator conducted their
                        analysis separate from one another to ensure this report did not rely on a single person’s
                        findings.</p>

                        created in Qualtrics to gain a better understanding of how these users communicate, both online

                        technology as well as their background as members of the Dead community. We received 10
                        responses</p>

                                An overarching theme was that videos on websites often lacked accurate captions. This
                                could lead to a frustrating user experience.</p>

                                Access to an interpreter is a barrier to accessibility for some ASL individuals. It is
                                crucial that any online dispute-resolving system allows for the opportunity to access an
                                interpreter if one is needed.</p>

                        target population. All interviews took place remotely while using Video Relay Services (VRS).
                        Video Relay Services allows ASL individuals to communicate with voice telephone users through
                        video equipment, rather than through typed text (FCC).</p>
