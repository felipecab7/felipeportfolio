                        <h3>Target audience</h3>
                        <p>For my senior design project, my team was tasked with improving the accessibility
                            of Franklin County’s Matterhorn platform for American Sign Language individuals. The main
                            goals
                            of
                            the project were to ensure that ASL individuals have the same "access" to justice,
                            regardless
                            of their level of comfort with online platforms and level of English proficiency.<br></p>


                        <h3>Understanding the why</h3>

                        <p>In order to understand ALS users mental models when it comes to accessing
                            online mediation, we developed a research phase plan involving five milestones and questions
                            related to these goals.<br></p>


                        <ul>

                                <p> Develop an understanding of <strong>how ASL individuals communicate,
                                        both with ASL and non-ASL individuals.</strong>

                                    online goals.</p>

                                    and how they aid or hinder these individuals in achieving their goals related to
                                    legal
                                    processes.</p>

                        <h4>Heuristic evaluation</h4>

                        <p>The Matterhorn platform for Franklin County Municipal Court was evaluated by eacg team
                            member. Each evaluator attempted to complete the core tasks of the platform, all while
                            evaluating each task against a set of usability heuristics. Each evaluator conducted their
                            analysis separate from one another to ensure this report did not rely on a single person’s
                            findings.</p>

                            responses</p>

                        <p>After distruibuing our survey, our team conducted user interviews with three members of our
                            target population. All interviews took place remotely while using Video Relay Services
                            (VRS).
                            Video Relay Services allows ASL individuals to communicate with voice telephone users
                            through
                            video equipment, rather than through typed text (FCC).</p>

                                    implemented a progress bar above the conversation space.

                                    users with a negative experience since messages on the platform tend to be long and
                                    more formal than other chat platforms.

                        <p>Contact was made into its own page. Additionally, the “login” button was moved into the top
                            navigation and it was visually differentiated from other navigation items so that it would
                            stand out to users. Thirdly, the navigation bar was made sticky, so that it scrolls down
                            with the user. Finally, the size of the banner was reduced so that less content is pushed
                            below the fold.</p>

                        <p>On this page, users fill out the request interpreter form in order to schedule an in-person
                            meeting with a court mediator and language intepreter. The form only requires users to input
                            their name, preferred form of contact, and the language they will need assistance in. Users
                            are redirected to this screen from the home page, contact page, and FAQ page.</p>



                        <h4>High-fidelity prototype: <u>Registration form</u></h4>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="css/imgs/registration-form.png" alt="image">


                        </figure>

                        <p>Following their click of the registration button on the Home page, users are asked to select
                            a case type. After they’ve selected their case, users wil be progress to the registration
                            form. The form is divided into three sections: personal info, case info, and clarification.
                            The three sections appear in the side drawer on left side of screen. The section a user is
                            currently in will be highlighted, helping users maintain an awareness of how far along in
                            the form they are as well as what section they’re in. Moreover, users can click a section
                            label in the side drawer to automatically scroll to the top of that section.
                            The registration form was stripped down to only include fields, not additional information
                            around the fields. Doing so shortened the form as well as reduced the noise, making it
                            easier for users to walk through. Latly, required fields are marked with an asterisk so that
                            users know what they need to fill out to be able to submit the form.

                        </figure>

                        <p>The “view details” was replaced with a forward arrow to better signify to users that they
                            will be taken to a new screen. Moreover, we made the entire container clickable, so that
                            user’s wouldn’t have to precisely click to navigate into their case.</p>

                        <p>The “Case type” and “Case number” labels were combined into one line since they’re closely
                            related and visually differentiated from other previewed info so that the user could
                            effortlessly scan down the Negotiations page to find their case.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, a Status label was added. It helps users further understand what case they’re
                            looking at and primes them with what actionables they should be focused on completing for
                            their case.</p>




                        <h4>High-fidelity prototype: <u>Mediation</u></h4>

                        </figure>

                        <p>A progress bar was added so that users could see their current case status at all times as
                            well as know how close they were to their goal of reaching a resolution.
                        </p>

                        <p>A fixed side drawer was added to ensure the previewed case info on the negotiations page was
                            carried over into the case itself and immediately visible to users. Moreover, the case
                            navigation (i.e. case status, case history, etc.) were moved onto the side drawer. The top
                            navigation on the platform is horizontal. Thus, the case navigation was made vertical to
                            differentiate it from the top navigation since the case navigation doesn’t redirect users to
                            a page outside of their case. Additionally, moving the case navigation to the far left of
                            the page, increased the vertical space for content on the right side of the screen.</p>



                        <h4>High-fidelity prototype: <u>Case status</u></h4>

                        </figure>

                        <p>An extension to the Case Status header was added that displays a more granular status than
                            what may be shown on the progress bar (e.g. review and sign agreement, terminated, etc.). To
                            extended status give users an idea of what their status is as well as what their actionables
                            are prior to reading the paragraph of text on the Case Status page.</p>



                        <h4>High-fidelity prototype: <u>Buttons and Toast notifications</u></h4>

                        <p><b>Buttons: </b>Colors were assigned to different states, signalling whether a feature was:
                            inactive, default or hovered. The inactive state was added to signify to users that the
                            action cannot be completed yet because they have not filled out the required information. It
                            tells the user that there’s still more left to do. When an inactive button is hovered over,
                            a block icon will appear next to the user’s cursor. When an active button is hovered, it
                            will slightly change in appearance and will move upward 1 pixel.</p>

                        <p><b>Toasts: </b>
                            When users complete a flow and are automatically redirected to another screen, a toast
                            notification briefly appears on the bottom of that screen to give users feedback that the
                            aciton they carried out on the previous screen was successfully completed by the system.</p>

                        <p>When a user clicks out of a field they’ve filled out, an error message will appear under that
                            field if it has been filled out incorrectly. The error messages were written such that they
                            assist users in understanding why their input was incorrect. Moreover, if a user attempts to
                            submit a form without filling out all required fields, an error message will appear under
                            each required field that hasn’t been filled out.</p>



                        <h3>Validation</h3>

                        <p>Our team conducted seven user tests to ensure the usability and clarity of our design
                            decisions regarding the Matterhorn platform. Despite the unforeseen circumstances
                            surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, our team conducted the user tests remotely using Google
                            Hangouts and screen sharing capabilities.</p>
