            <p>The School of Information website targets prospective students, employers,
                community partners, alumni, donors and current students. In order to gain more
                knowledge on how to improve the usability of the site, I chose the most important
                target user --prospective students-- and conducted a Heuristic Evaluation analysis of
                the tasks they would carry out when exploring the site for the first time. As I
                stepped through each task, I recorded issues based on Nielsen’s 10 usability
                heuristics for user interface design, assigned a severity rating, and presented both
                written recommendations and redesigns that I believe can improve the
                learnability, efficiency, memorability and satisfaction of the site.</p>

                students have in the context of choosing a major. To do this I used the
                Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework --developed by pioneer Tony Ulwik back in 1991 and later
                popularized by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen in 1991-- in order
                to identify the core functional, social, and emotional needs of prospective students.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Actionable and non-actionable elements of the site have the same color.</strong> When
                hovering over the menu handle “About UMSI'', the color changes from green to
                yellow (the same yellow of the title “Information Changes Everything”, the button
                “UMSI” COVID-19 Updates and Resources” and “Header Menu”). Since the same
                yellow is assigned to multiple elements on the same page, it is difficult for the user
                to associate it with an indication of status. Internal consistency is also broken as the
                design of the title “information changes everything” looks almost the same as the
                other yellow elements.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Problem 2 </strong></h4>

            <br>

            <p>Main buttons on the main menu and buttons on the header menu at the top of the
                page don’t show any feedback to the user when hovering over while drop-down
                menu buttons change their format to bold. This breaks internal consistency as the
                user should not have to use cognitive resources to understand why different
                menus give feedback and some don’t. When users are first exposed to a menu
                
                feedback, they build a mental model of how this feedback works and assigns a
                meaning to it. When exposed to the same cue (another button) and the feedback is
                not present, users might see it as an error and ignore it.</p>


            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="section-item-image">
                <img src="css/imgs/case1/problem2.png" alt="Felipe Portrait">
            </div>
            <br>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Heuristic violated: </strong>Consistency and Standards Severity: Minor Issue - Hinders the user's
                ability to navigate and should be fixed when possible</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>This can be fixed by giving all actionable buttons the same or
                similar feedback so users don’t have to rely on extra cognitive effort to understand
                their function or meaning.</p>


                <br>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Problem 3 </strong></h4>
    
                <br>

            <br>

            <p>Drop-down menus are too long and have too many options. This increases
                visual-search time (amount of time it takes the user to visually identify the piece of
                information they are looking for) and movement time (time it takes to move the
                cursor to get to the element). Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for
                
                a person to move a mouse cursor to a target area is a function of the distance to the
                target divided by the size of the target. In the screenshot below, we could see how
                only five menu options are within reach above the second green line. Past this line,
                options lose visibility.</p>


            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="section-item-image">

            <p><strong>Heuristic violated: </strong>Consistency and Standards. Severity: Major Issue - Frustrates or confused
                users and requires repair as soon as possible.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>This problem could be fixed by having a mega menu or
                rectangular menu. This will prevent any scrolling problems that users might
                encounter when using a small screen and will reduce the time it takes to both
                visually identify the button and click on it.</p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Taking these into consideration, I reorganized the content and created a
                megamenu where the visual-search time and movement time are improved. I then
                placed the same green line and we can see how most of the menu options (9) are
                now within reach with only one exception.</p>

                <p><strong>Titles and subtitles on the main page are not properly aligned.</strong> The title

                <br>
    
                <p>The Header, Navigation Menu, Content and Footer sections <strong>appear to be grouped
                    together </strong>due to the white background and different sections <strong>are too close to each
                        other.</strong> This might confuse users as they can’t easily identify what the different
                    sections of the site are. In the case of the UMSI homepage, the lack of a change in
                    background color, makes sections like the header and content look like one piece
                    of information --decreasing discoverability of relevant information. Additionally,
                    the white space between the articles in the “News” section is the same as the
                    “Events'' section. This small detail makes the “Events” section harder to identify.</p>

            <p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>This problem could be fixed by having a mega menu or
                rectangular menu. This will prevent any scrolling problems that users might
                encounter when using a small screen and will reduce the time it takes to both
                visually identify the button and click on it.</p>

            <p>Two catastrophic, four major and two minor usability problems in the site’s

            <br>

            <h4><strong>Catastrophic Issues </strong></h4>

            <br>

            <p>Too many colors on the homepage: White, blue, purple, black, green.
                Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Picture at the top of the “Mission” page occupies most of the space.
                Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.</p>
            <br>

            <h4><strong>Major Issues </strong></h4>

            <br>

            <p>Drop-down menus are too long and have too many options. Heuristic:
                Consistency and Standards.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The Header, Navigation Menu, Content and Footer sections appear to be
                grouped together due to the white background and different sections are too
                close to each other. Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Sections of the page have a very similar visual weight. Heuristic: Aesthetic and
                Minimalist Design.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Users need to scroll down, scan the video, and read the text in order to find
                the most important information, increasing visual-search time. Heuristic:
                Recognition rather than recall.</p>
            <br>

            <h4><strong>Minor issues </strong></h4>

            <br>

            <p>Actionable and non-actionable elements of the site have the same color.
                Heuristic: Visibility of System Status</p>
            <br>

            <p>Main buttons on the main menu and buttons on the header menu at the top
                of the page don’t show any feedback to the user when hovering over while
                
                drop-down menu buttons change their format to bold Heuristic: Consistency
                and Standards.</p>
            <br>

        

            <p>Titles and subtitles on the main page are not properly aligned. Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.</p>

            <br>
            

            <p>The quicker and more ef effectively users are exposed to information that meets their
                needs, the higher the likelihood that they will make an effort to engage. This has to
                do with the way we process information --Daniel Kaneman in his book “Thinking
                Fast and Slow” describes the two modes in which we process information:.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong>System 1 (Fast): </strong>The automatic, intuitive and emotional part of the brain which
                    operates with little or no conscious effort and no sense of voluntary control. We
                    engage system 1 to make intuitive decisions without having to use much cognitive
                    resources.</p>
    
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>System 2 (Slow): </strong>The analytical and rational part of the brain which takes care of
                        effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations and
                        analyzing vast amounts of information. Slower system of the brain. Takes up most
                        cognitive resources.</p>
        
                        <br>

                        <p>We make many of our daily decisions based on the suggestions System 1 gives
                            System 2: if we see a stop sign (we stop immediately), if we feel anxious (we check
                            social media), if we are in a room full of people (we follow stereotypes), if we
                            encounter a new portfolio website that is aesthetically pleasing (we trust it). We
                            have built-in neurological pathways that allow us to make sense of the world
                            without having to use much of our cognitive resources. System 1 and System 2
                            exist to minimize effort so we can concentrate on demanding tasks that require
                            our attention: building a new habit, engaging in a debate, reading a long text,
                            solving a math problem.
                            
                            Following this logic, the question of whether a website has good usability (how easy
                            and pleasant are user interfaces to use) or not, is a question of how much of system
                            1 and 2 is at play when a user experiences an interface interaction. System 1 helps
                            us scan relevant information and judge credibility on the spot. If information on a
                            website is inconsistent, irrelevant, does not match real world conventions and is
                            not easily visible, users' ability to quickly build mental models will be hindered,
                            causing them to rely on System 2 to make choices. In other words, the more we
                            make people “think”, the more likely they are to go somewhere else where a high
                            cognitive effort is not required. I mention these two systems throughout the
                            analysis to explain the reasons behind each argument.</p>
