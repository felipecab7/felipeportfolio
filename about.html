                It was the day of the show. Minutes before going on stage I
                heard my name. My excitement had turned into terror, my heart
                kept beating faster every second and my hands would not stop
                sweating. A couple of months prior, I had been given the
                opportunity to sing at my brothers prom, in front of two hundred
                people. I was fifteen and had never played in front of of an
                audience besides small family gatherings, so you can imagine how
                I was feeling.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once I got to the door behind stage, I was given a microphone.
                But something was wrong — it was a wireless microphone, unlike
                the one we had been using in rehearsal. As if I wasn't already
                nervous that my voice would be heard by two hundred people, I
                knew that If I didn't move around stage I would look awkward,
                lost and nervous. My mom was in the front row and the last thing
                I wanted was to disappoint her.
              </p>

              <p>
                I finally got on stage, lights went on, and I started singing. I
                sounded a little nervous at first, but as time passed, I became
                more comfortable. I focused so much on the song that I forgot
                the audience was there. It was as if stepping on stage brought
                out an inner self alive with energy and confidence. It felt
                amazing. Despite my far from perfect performance, it felt right
                to be in front of an audience and see their emotional response.
              </p>

              <p>
                I wasn't the best at singing, but fortunately I knew how to
                playing the piano. This pushed me to continue learning how to
                read music and convey emotions through songs. I then picked up
                other interests in filmmaking, painting and graphic design.
                After analyzing multiple career paths, I realized the underlying
                reason I loved making songs, paintings, and short-films was the
                story structure behind them. It was fascinating to see how a
                well-crafted story can impact somebody's life: How an animated
                movie can me adults cry, how a song can make an audience sit on
                the edge of their seats and how a great story can make designers
                engage in a more personal way with users. There is no doubt this
                is the reason I loved performing from the beginning. All those
                family gatherings were the best channel for me to
                <u>inspire people through storytelling.</u>

              <p>
                My increased interest in graphic design and storytelling led me
                to apply to the School of Information at the University of
                Michigan where I earned a degree in User Experience Design. I
                learned how to better listen to users, understand the story
                behind their struggles and engage with teammates and
                stakeholders in discussions grounded in those root needs. I
                learned that —just like in a movie —users see themselves as the
                hero in their own lives on a journey, with a set of obstacles,
                wanting to make progress and wanting to hire products that help
                them overcome those struggles. As a UX designer, that is what I
                strive to do. I want to make sure those struggling moments drive
                the product development process so that the solutions I create
                can change and inspire people.
