                <h3>Target audience</h3>
                <p>
                  The School of Information website targets prospective students,
                  employers, community partners, alumni, donors and current
                  students. In order to gain more knowledge on how to improve the
                  usability of the site, I chose the most important target user
                  --prospective students-- and conducted a Heuristic Evaluation
                  analysis of the tasks they would carry out when exploring the
                  site for the first time. As I stepped through each task, I
                  recorded issues based on Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics for
                  user interface design, assigned a severity rating, and presented
                  both written recommendations and redesigns that I believe can
                  improve the learnability, efficiency, memorability and
                  satisfaction of the site.<br />
                </p>
  
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
  
                <p>
                  In order to create a function/task list, I first identified the
                  root needs prospective students have in the context of choosing
                  a major. To do this I used the Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework
                  --developed by pioneer Tony Ulwik back in 1991 and later
                  popularized by Harvard Business School professor Clayton
                  Christensen in 1991-- in order to identify the core functional,
                  social, and emotional needs of prospective students.<br />

                <h3>Rating system</h3>
                <p>
                  Keeping in mind Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics for user
                  interface design I recorded each problem and assigned one of the
                  following severity ratings to it:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Minor Issue: Hinders the user's ability to navigate and
                      should be fixed when possible
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Major Issue: Frustrates or confuses users and requires
                      repair as soon as possible
                    </p>
                  </li>
  
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Catastrophic Issue: Prohibits users from performing their
                      given task and requires an immediate modification
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
  
                <h3>Findings and Recommendations</h3>
                <h4>Problem 1</h4>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >Actionable and non-actionable elements of the site have the
                    same color. </b
                  >When hovering over the menu handle “About UMSI'', the color
                  changes from green to yellow (the same yellow of the title
                  “Information Changes Everything”, the button “UMSI” COVID-19
                  Updates and Resources” and “Header Menu”). Since the same yellow
                  is assigned to multiple elements on the same page, it is
                  difficult for the user to associate it with an indication of
                  status. Internal consistency is also broken as the design of the
                  title “information changes everything” looks almost the same as
                  the other yellow elements
                </p>

                  >while drop-down menu buttons change their format to bold. This
                  breaks internal consistency as the user should not have to use
                  cognitive resources to understand why different menus give
                  feedback and some don’t. When users are first exposed to a menu
                  feedback, they build a mental model of how this feedback works
                  and assigns a meaning to it. When exposed to the same cue
                  (another button) and the feedback is not present, users might
                  see it as an error and ignore it.

                <h4>Problem 3</h4>
                <p>
                  <b>Drop-down menus are too long and have too many options. </b
                  >This increases visual-search time (amount of time it takes the
                  user to visually identify the piece of information they are
                  looking for) and movement time (time it takes to move the cursor
                  to get to the element). Fitts' law states that the amount of
                  time required for a person to move a mouse cursor to a target
                  area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the
                  size of the target. In the screenshot below, we could see how
                  only five menu options are within reach above the second green
                  line. Past this line, options lose visibility..

                <h4>Problem 5</h4>
                <p>
                  The Header, Navigation Menu, Content and Footer sections
                  <b>appear to be grouped together</b> due to the white background
                  and different sections are too close to each other. This might
                  confuse users as they can’t easily identify what the different
                  sections of the site are. In the case of the UMSI homepage, the
                  lack of a change in background color, makes sections like the
                  header and content look like one piece of information
                  --decreasing discoverability of relevant information.
                  Additionally, the white space between the articles in the “News”
                  section is the same as the “Events'' section. This small detail
                  makes the “Events” section harder to identify.

                  community, fun and progressive. Showcasing people builds empathy
