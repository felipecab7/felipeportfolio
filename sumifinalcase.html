                        main theme: Weaving the Threads within the Social Fabric. We
                        were encouraged to consider the ways that technology might be
                        used to strengthen our social fabric --how individuals interact
                        with each other within a community. We choose to tackle the
                        problem many people face when making new year's resolutions:
                        following through with those promises. We believed one of the
                        reasons this happens is the lack of an accountability system
                        where goals would be shared in a group setting and members would
                        push each other to succeed.</div>

                    <div class="p2 "> Our high fidelity prototype was the culmination of weeks spent
                        ideating, desining and iterating. We transitioned to digital
                        after learning through mockups, wireframes and paper prototypes
                        what impact our ideas would have on users. Thanks to the nature
                        of rapid iteration, many of the wrong assumptions we had were
                        discarded and that helped us move forward towards
                        functionalities that based on data made a positive impact on
                        users.</div>
