              <h3>Research Data</h3>

              <p>
                In this section, I give a more detailed explanation as to how I uncovered the design requirements mentioned above. 
                
              </p>


              <h4>Step 1</h4>



              <p>The first step was to assess the current experience of Chichi’s
                customers and identify the causality of their behavior. I kicked
                off the research process with the following goals.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify what causes Chichi’s customers to pick up their
                    phone and order Chichi’s.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify functional, emotional and social needs related to
                    the core task they are trying to accomplish.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify Chichi’s customer’s desired outcomes associated
                    with getting their core task done.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Interviews</h4>

              <p>
                I designed an interview protocol with mostly open-ended
                questions aimed at getting to the heart of the struggles
                Chichi’s customers face. I then conducted 20 user interviews via
                phone call with customers that had bought Chichi’s products
                within the last 2 months.
              </p>

              <h4>Affinity diagram</h4>

              <p>
                With the raw interview data at hand, I created sticky notes and
                consolidated quotes into main themes. Uncovering initial mental
                models.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img
                  id="myimage"
                  src="css/imgs/interview-data.png"
                  alt="image"
                />
              </figure>

              <i>Initial themes discovered</i>

              <h3></h3>

              <h4>Journey Map</h4>

              <p>
                After gaining an initial understanding of the main needs and
                behaviors, I designed a map containing the journey a Chichis
                customer goes through from beginning to end and connected quotes
                and themes to each step of the process. This allowed me to
                visualize the mental models of users as the story unfolds and
                uncover not only functional needs but powerful emotional and
                social dimensions.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="css/imgs/last-iteration-white.png" alt="image" />
              </figure>

              <p>
                The middle section of the diagram contains Chichis customer
                journey from beginning to end. The light green bubbles represent
                quotes from the interviews classified as wants, desires, and
                gains; the darker green represents uncovered themes consolidated
                into emotions; and the black bubbles at the top represent
                measurable desired outcomes that can be used to build and
                measure possible solutions. When laying out the data this way,
                it is easier to dig deep into causality and find processes,
                struggles and unmet needs that could otherwise go unnoticed.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an example, a frustration mentioned in the interviews was the
                inability to choose substitutes on the fly when choosing a
                product. This has to do with the way they currently communicate
                their orders to Chichis staff. Since Chichis customers are
                usually ordering as a group and orders are being handled through
                Snapchat and text, a member of the friend group asks everyone
                what they want to eat, and sends the order to Chichis. Since
                they have to wait until Chichis responds back (usually more than
                15 minutes), when there is an item out of stock, the group
                member placing the order has to go back and ask his or her
                friends what substitutes they want and then go through the
                process of writing the order again. By digging deeper into the
                frustration of not being able to identify what items are out of
                stock I was able to uncover a deeper underserved need: being
                able to exchange information with friends easily when deciding
                what to order.
              </p>

              <h4>Findings</h4>

              <figure>
                <img
                  src="css/imgs/design/desired-statements-v2.png"

              </figure>

              <p>
                After gaining a deeper understanding of the mental model of
                Chichi’s customers I hypothesized that chichi’s customers are
                looking for solutions that:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Reduce time it takes to identify and select a product.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Increase ability to have control over purchase progress.
                  </p>

              <h3>Design and Ideation</h3>

              <h4>Stage 01: Building empathy</h4>

              <p>
                As mentioned above, stories must be at the center of the product
                development process. Without believable characters, stories
                don't make an impact. Well-crafted personas act as the main
                characters in a movie and are the best way to build empathy
                among teams and make their struggles and desires memorable.

                Anna is ordering Chichis after a long day. It's 1 am on a
                Thursday night, she has had a few drinks and the last thing she
                wants to do is to sorth thorugh long menus to decide what to
                eat.

              <p><b>Why is it important to her?</b></p>

              <p>
                One of Anna's biggest pain points is her inability to monitor
                her order status. Not being told that the order has been
                acknowledged or getting her order way past the stipulated
                estimate time of arrival makes her feel like she doesn't have
                control of her own time. She wants solutions that engage and
                empower her.

                    <b>Continuous feedback: </b>Full and continuous feedback.
                    Given Anna's low energy levels and her desire to be certain
                    about the progress she is making throughout the purchase
                    process, it is important to keep her engaged through
                    constant feedback and continuous communication.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Stage 03: Generating ideas</h4>

              <p>
                The current Chichis menu is organized as follows: Combos,
                Empanadas, Goodies, drinks, and sauces. Each item can be bought
                separately except for the sauces. The initial brainstorming
                process helped me get a picture of how the current categories of
                the menu align with Anna's needs. This process raised key
                questions such as how items should be grouped and how she should
                go about selecting individual items as well as combos.
              </p>

              <p>
                I tackled these questions using a semiformal notation called QOC
                (Questions, Options, and Criteria) which allowed me to visualize
                potential solutions to a question and compare them based on a
                set of criteria defined in stage 2. Progressive disclosure, high
                familiarity, visual-search time, and continuous feedback.
              </p>

              <p><b>Q1: how to display products on the main page?</b></p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>Option one (O1): </b>Conventional approach with multiple
                    categories shown at once on the main page. Having the user
                    look at the categories (Combos, Empanadas, Drinks, Goodies)
                    and scroll down is linked positively to High familiarity,
                    but it's linked negatively to progressive disclosure (since
                    all the menu items are presented at once), visual-search
                    time (Anna has to scroll down to find items) and continuos
                    feedback (there is no engagement or interaction that prompts
                    feedback)

                </li>

                  <p>
                    <b>Option two (O2): </b>Linked positively to progressive
                    disclosure (only two options are presented), visual search
                    time (faster to identify two options as opposed to 5+),
                    continuous feedback, and negatively to high familiarity
                    (Since most food delivery sites display multiple categories
                    at once Anna has to establish proficiency when encountering
                    a new method).

                  <p>
                    <b>Option one (O1): </b>A collapse menu feature would
                    require Anna to go through two interactions, click on the
                    title, and displaying the information within the category.
                    It is linked positively to progressive disclosure (title
                    appears first and items within category appear after she
                    taps on the title, only the items of one category are
                    displayed at a time), visual-search time (since only one
                    category is displayed at a time, there is less scrolling,
                    helping Anna find information faster) and prompt feedback
                    (having to tap on each title keeps Anna engaged). The only
                    negative assessment is its lack of familiarity.

                    food delivery home screen with the two categories and its
                    items below each title. It is linked negatively to
                    progressive disclosure (all information is presented at
                    once), prompt feedback (no interactions), and visual search
                    time. It is linked positively to high familiarity (most food
                    delivery sites display all their menu info at once).
