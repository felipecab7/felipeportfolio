              <h3>The problem</h3>

              <p>
                With the promise of delivering fresh authentic latin american
                food to University of Michigan students, Chichi’s quickly gained
                popularity on campus. It only offered a convenient way to get
                food delivered to students at night, but it also exposed
                students to rich latin-american cuisine originating from
                countries such as venezuela, cuba, and argentina. This prompted
                its founders to look for ways to improve its delivery process,
                which was becoming a frustration to many customers as most of
                the interactions were happening through multiple applications
                (Snapchat, Text, and Venmo).
              </p>

              <p>
                I was asked to develop a full-stack application that could solve
                this problem. This involved:

              <h3>Understanding the why</h3>

              <p>
                The first step was to assess the current experience of Chichi’s
                ordering process from a user-centered perspective and identify
                the causality of their behavior. I kicked off the research
                process with the following goals.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify what causes Chichi’s customers to pick up their
                    phone and order Chichi’s.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify functional, emotional and social needs related to
                    the core task they are trying to accomplish.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Identify Chichi’s customer’s desired outcomes associated
                    with getting their core task done.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Interviews</h4>

              <p>
                I designed an interview protocol with mostly open-ended
                questions aimed at getting to the heart of the struggles
                Chichi’s customers face. I then conducted 20 user interviews via
                phone call with customers that had bought Chichi’s products
                within the last 2 months.
              </p>

              <h4>Affinity diagram</h4>

              <p>
                I then created sticky notes with quotes from the interviews and
                consolidated them into main themes. Uncovering initial mental
                models.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img
                  id="myimage"
                  src="css/imgs/interview-data.png"
                  alt="image"
                />
              </figure>

              <i>Initial themes discovered</i>

              <h3></h3>

              <h4>Journey Map</h4>

              <p>
                After gaining an initial understanding of the main needs and
                behaviors, I designed a map containing the journey of a Chichi’s
                customer from beginning to end and connected quotes and themes
                to each step of the process. This allowed me to visualize the
                mental models of users as the story unfolds and uncover not only
                functional needs but powerful emotional and social dimensions.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="css/imgs/last-iteration-white.png" alt="image" />
              </figure>

              <p>
                The middle section of the diagram contains Chichi’s customer
                journey from beginning to end. The light green bubbles represent
                quotes from the interviews classified as wants, desires, and
                gains; the darker green represents uncovered themes consolidated
                into emotions; and the black bubbles at the top represent
                measurable desired outcomes that can be used to build and
                measure possible solutions. When laying out the data this way,
                it is easier to dig deep into causality and find processes,
                struggles and unmet needs that could otherwise go unnoticed.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an example, an uncovered frustration was the inability to
                choose substitutes on the fly when choosing a product. This has
                to do with the way they currently communicate their orders to
                Chichi’s staff. Since Chichi’s customers are usually ordering as
                a group and orders are being handled through Snapchat and text,
                a member of the friend group asks everyone what they want to
                eat, and sends the order to Chichi’s. Since they have to wait
                until Chichi’s responds back (usually more than 15 minutes),
                when there is an item out of stock, the group member placing the
                order has to go back and ask his or her friends what substitutes
                they want and then go through the process of writing the order
                again. By digging deeper into the frustration of not being able
                to identify what items are out of stock I was able to uncover a
                deeper underserved need: being able to exchange information with
                friends easily when deciding what to order.
              </p>

              <h4>Findings</h4>

              <figure>

              <p>
                After gaining a deeper understanding of the mental model of
                Chichi’s customers I hypothesized that chichi’s customers are
                looking for solutions that:

                    Increase their ability to ensure delivery fees are
